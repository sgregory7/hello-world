My first practice repository.

Hello fellow programmers! 

I'm Steven Gregory. I was born and raised in the metropolitan area of New York City. Now, I live in South Carolina, the Palmetto State. The pace of life was drastically slower when I first moved here 40 years ago. Finally, we've pretty much caught up with the pace of the rest of the world.
